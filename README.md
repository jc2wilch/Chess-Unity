# Chess-Unity

My first ever Unity and C# project besides a 'Guess the Number' game I made when following a tutorial.
You will need 2 players as there is no AI to play against... yet

I'm sorry to whomever tries to read my spaghetti code of 1800 lines in a single doc :(
I will *hopefully* try to optimize it a bit more and split up my code to make it look prettier in the future.
